On the basis of group project, I referred to some videos related to ‘wheel’ animation to enrich the animation effects of my work.

When considering timers and events to create an animation, my first consideration is to regularly change the background color and mouse click events. This is because the concentric circles and small ellipses in the group work may be too monotonous if simply changed, so timer and events can be used to create a series of concentric circles and small ellipses with different rotation speeds, colors, and shapes in the work, while achieving the concepts of background color change and event interaction. Based on the above thinking, my personal work creates an animation effect where concentric circles and small ellipses rotate at different speeds and colors, and the background color changes over time. Users can also interactively change the animation effect through the mouse and keyboard, creating a visually captivating interactive artwork.
